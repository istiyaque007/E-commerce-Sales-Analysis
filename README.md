Goal - Utilizing data-driven information to enhance and optimize sales performance.

Actions
Data Cleansing - involves using Power Query to improve the quality of your data by removing redundant or unnecessary information. This process includes actions like removing duplicate entries, changing column names for clarity, and adjusting data types as needed.

Data Transformation - This entails the process of loading and applying the refined dataset within Power BI to get it ready for analysis and visualization. This involves preparing the data so that it can be effectively used to derive insights and create visual representations.

Data Presentation -Involves the creation of new calculated measures and columns in Power BI using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions. These functions, such as counting, summing, and calculating, are used to craft meaningful and informative visual representations of the data. This step helps in conveying insights and information effectively through visual elements.
